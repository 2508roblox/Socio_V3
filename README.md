# Featurs included in this project:
- Authentication: The project includes routes for user authentication, such as /login and /register. These routes handle user login and account registration.

- Authorization: The project includes access control mechanisms to protect certain routes. The accessTokenValidator middleware is used to validate the access token and ensure that only authenticated users can access protected routes.

- Hash Password: The project likely includes functionality to securely hash passwords. Although the specific implementation is not visible in the provided code snippet, it is common practice to hash passwords before storing them in a database to enhance security.

- JSON Web Token (JWT): JSON Web Tokens are commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes. The project likely utilizes JWTs for generating access tokens and refreshing tokens, as indicated by the /refresh-token route.
